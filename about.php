			<p><br><br><center>In the medical diagnostic system procedures, elucidation of the etiology of the disease or conditions of interest, that is, what caused the disease or condition and its origin is not entirely necessary. Such elucidation can be useful to optimize treatment, further specify the prognosis or prevent recurrence of the disease or condition in the future. <br>                          
			   <br>  <u>   1.   INTRODUCTION </u>  <br>



This project is to detect the human, plant & animal diseases and provide the solutions to recover 
from the diseases. We planned to design our project with a system that provides software which 
tells us about the disease and its cure by providing just the symptoms.
In our proposed system we are providing a solution to recover from the diseases and also show 
the affected part of the body or plant. The existing system can only identify the type of diseases 
which affects the body. We will provide a result within fraction of seconds and guided you
 throughout the project. We briefly explain about the experimental analysis of our methodology.<br><br>
 <u><b>MAIN OBJECTIVE:-</b></u><br>
 	Due to increasing disease in the environment a tool is required just to provide the information 
about the symptoms you provide and important tests related to it. This tool does not provide medical advice. It is intended for informational purpose only. <br>

 	The main objective of the project is to provide software that helps the user to understand their disease more accurately.

 	This projects aims on providing the users a detailed description of their disease.<br>

 	The user can use different categories for disease detection.<br>
